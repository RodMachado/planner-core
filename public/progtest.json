Their last and biggest display was presented at the 1984 Worldcon which included the famous U.N.C.L.E. car, a rolling weapon, a la Bond's Aston Martin. Bill was also personally responsible for the extensive exhibit from the Ackerman collection on display at that Worldcon. Bill and Bob won so many awards at masquerades that they officially took themselves out of competition, but continued to perform as masquerade half-time entertainment and/or MC's. Robert (Bob) Short eventually went on to win the Academy Award for Special Effects Makeup for *Beetlejuice*.\n\nBill is a fan of fan history and fervently believes it should be respected, remembered and preserved.

In 2005 Brandon held his first published novel, *Elantris*, in his hands. Tor also published Brandon's Mistborn trilogy, followed by *Warbreaker* and then *The Way of Kings*, the first in the planned ten-volume series The Stormlight Archive. He was chosen to complete Robert Jordan\u2019s Wheel of Time series; 2009's *The Gathering Storm* and 2010's *Towers of Midnight* will be followed by the final book in the series, *A Memory of Light*, in 2012. And four books in his middle-grade Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians series have been released by Scholastic.\n\nCurrently living in Utah with his wife and children, Brandon teaches creative writing at Brigham Young University. He also hosts the writing advice podcast [Writing Excuses](http://www.writingexcuses.com/) with Howard Tayler and Dan Wells.","website":"http://brandonsanderson.com","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/Mistborn"},{"pubFirstName":"Ellen","pubLastName":"Klages","pubSuffix":"","id":20237,"twitterinfo":"","bio":"","website":"","facebook":""},{"pubFirstName":"James","pubLastName":"Bacon","pubSuffix":"","id":70,"twitterinfo":"","bio":"","website":"","facebook":""},{"pubFirstName":"David-Glenn","pubLastName":"Anderson","pubSuffix":"","id":40,"twitterinfo":"","bio":"David-Glenn Anderson was born in Utah.

They performed as a stunt team doing live shows with a specialty act group when only 16 years old and they collaborated on many amateur film productions together. Bill has been involved in SF fandom since 1969 when he first attended a LASFS meeting. His first SF convention was the 1970 Westercon XXIII where he and Bob Short were exhibitors showing their extensive collection of props/wardrobe/scripts etc. from the TV series *The Man From U.N.C.L.E.*, and at which they entered and won their first convention masquerade award. Their last and biggest display was presented at the 1984 Worldcon which included the famous U.N.C.L.E. car, a rolling weapon, a la Bond's Aston Martin. Bill was also personally responsible for the extensive exhibit from the Ackerman collection on display at that Worldcon. Bill and Bob won so many awards at masquerades that they officially took themselves out of competition, but continued to perform as masquerade half-time entertainment and/or MC's. Robert (Bob) Short eventually went on to win the Academy Award for Special Effects Makeup for *Beetlejuice*.\n\nBill is a fan of fan history and fervently believes it should be respected, remembered and preserved.

In 1995 he suddenly realized that he could live anywhere and they decamped from Toronto, that large, cold, gray city on Lake Ontario, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico.  He became an American citizen in 2004.  His latest books are *The Council of Shadows* (May 2011) and *The Tears of the Sun*  (September, 2011), from Roc/Penguin. His hobbies mostly involve reading -- history, anthropology, archaeology, and travel, besides fiction -- but he also cooks and bakes for fun and food.  For twenty years he also pursued the martial arts, until hyperextension injuries convinced him he was in danger of becoming the most deadly cripple in human history.  Currently he lives with Janet and the compulsory authorial cats.","website":"http://www.smstirling.com","facebook":""},{"pubFirstName":"Steve","pubLastName":"Miller","pubSuffix":"","id":1329,"twitterinfo":"http://twitter.com/bechimo","bio":"Steve Miller wrote for fanzines in the US, France, and Texas in the 1960s, graduating to writing professional fiction after teaching SF, attending Clarion West, and founding the UMBC SF Research Collection.

He had a typical American existence of going to a public school where he pretended to learn from people who pretended to teach. In between, he did the typical growing up things for a future sci-fi author: role playing games, drugs, sex, movies and television, and lots of reading science fiction. In a humorous turn of events, he became one of the mindless drones of bureaucracy, a public school teacher. He found allot of teaching could be accomplished as long as it didn't get in the way of the job. Then his brother came along and said, \"Hey story man, we should write a book together.\u201d Eight years later in April 2009, *The Unincorporated Man* was published by Tor. Happily this did well enough that *The Unincorporated War* came out in May of 2010 and the first book won the Prometheus Award for best novel. A third book *The Unincorporated Woman* will come out in August 2011 and four short stories have been completed.  So by some strange turn of events this has turned into a prolific career for the Kollin Brothers. Eytan hopes this turns into a profitable career as well (Bwa-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha).","website":"http://www.theunincorporatedman.com/","facebook":""}],"published_room":{"name":"A09","id":14,"published_venue_id":1,"published_venue":{"name":"RSCC","id":1}},"timeString":"0819 17:00","id":37,"precis":"Brothers and collaborators Dani & Etyan Kollin discuss economics.","pub_number":"37"},{"duration":60,"published_time_slot":{"id":408,"start":"2011-08-19T17:00:00-07:00"},"short_title":"The Grittier Side of Fantasy","title":"Mud and Blood: The Grittier Side of Fantasy","shortDate":"08/19","people":[{"pubFirstName":"Ken","pubLastName":"Scholes","pubSuffix":"","id":6398,"twitterinfo":"","bio":"Ken Scholes is the critically acclaimed author of the Psalms of Isaak series, published in the US by Tor Books.

Bill was also personally responsible for the extensive exhibit from the Ackerman collection on display at that Worldcon. Bill and Bob won so many awards at masquerades that they officially took themselves out of competition, but continued to perform as masquerade half-time entertainment and/or MC's. Robert (Bob) Short eventually went on to win the Academy Award for Special Effects Makeup for *Beetlejuice*.\n\nBill is a fan of fan history and fervently believes it should be respected, remembered and preserved. In 2005, he established [The Voices of Fandom](http://TheVoicesOfFandom.com), devoted to saving and showcasing audios/videos (vintage, rare or newly recorded) of potential interest to the fannish community. There is also a sizable photo archive with rare and historic photos of fans and pros from the 1930's onward. Lee Gold has called it a \"great fannish resource.\"\n\nBill currently produces audio books for REB Audiobooks, a division of Renaissance eBooks Incorporated. Nearly all of his 30-some audiobooks have been best sellers and are always among the highest rated abooks on the various online stores.

In a humorous turn of events, he became one of the mindless drones of bureaucracy, a public school teacher.

He was born in 1961 in Paisley, a town near Glasgow, Scotland where he grew up. He was interested in SF, Space and Science almost from birth, which he blames on the moon-race, *Doctor Who* and *Thunderbirds*. A voracious early reader of SF, he retains a love of Hard SF to this day. His science background led him to start work with a multinational energy company in 1987, and his career has taken him from Glasgow to London in the UK, then Muscat in Oman and later Groningen and currently The Hague in The Netherlands, where his ever-expanding book and art collection is probably contributing to that country's sinking below sea-level.  Along the way he found time to continue working on numerous conventions at various levels, notably the music programme at the 2009 Eastercon LX, fulfilling a long-held dream to have a symphony orchestra at a con! He has also become more involved with the Hugo Awards and occasionally contributes comments and articles to fanzines. He remains an active con-runner, including several current Worldcons and bids, and is the 2011 Hugo Award administrator, although he considers he has largely 'hung up his kilt' in regard to chairing Worldcons! His contributions were recognised as Fan Guest of Honour at the 2011 British National Convention.","website":"http://www.facebook.com/vincent.docherty","facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/vincent.docherty"},{"pubFirstName":"Rachael","pubLastName":"Livermore","pubSuffix":"","id":1142,"twitterinfo":"","bio":"","website":"","facebook":""},{"pubFirstName":"Inge","pubLastName":"Heyer","pubSuffix":"","id":9656,"twitterinfo":"","bio":"Inge Heyer was born and raised in Berlin, Germany.

He graduated from law school in Canada but had his dorsal fin surgically removed, and published his first novel (*Snowbrother*) in 1984, going full-time as a writer in 1988, the year of his marriage to Janet Moore of Milford, Massachusetts, who he met, wooed and proposed to at successive World Fantasy Conventions.

He was born in 1961 in Paisley, a town near Glasgow, Scotland where he grew up. He was interested in SF, Space and Science almost from birth, which he blames on the moon-race, *Doctor Who* and *Thunderbirds*. A voracious early reader of SF, he retains a love of Hard SF to this day. His science background led him to start work with a multinational energy company in 1987, and his career has taken him from Glasgow to London in the UK, then Muscat in Oman and later Groningen and currently The Hague in The Netherlands, where his ever-expanding book and art collection is probably contributing to that country's sinking below sea-level.  Along the way he found time to continue working on numerous conventions at various levels, notably the music programme at the 2009 Eastercon LX, fulfilling a long-held dream to have a symphony orchestra at a con! He has also become more involved with the Hugo Awards and occasionally contributes comments and articles to fanzines. He remains an active con-runner, including several current Worldcons and bids, and is the 2011 Hugo Award administrator, although he considers he has largely 'hung up his kilt' in regard to chairing Worldcons! His contributions were recognised as Fan Guest of Honour at the 2011 British National Convention.","website":"http://www.facebook.com/vincent.docherty","facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/vincent.docherty"},{"pubFirstName":"Mike","pubLastName":"Glyer","pubSuffix":"","id":690,"twitterinfo":"","bio":"","website":"","facebook":""},{"pubFirstName":"Elaine","pubLastName":"Stiles","pubSuffix":"","id":1883,"twitterinfo":"","bio":"I am married to artist Steve Stiles and have inspired him to start work on a novel of his own.
